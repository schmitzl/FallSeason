This project has been developed as part of the course <a href"">Computer Game Design</a>.


Fall Season is a casual falling game where you guide the main character equipped only with an umbrella downwards using gusts of wind as your primary interaction tool. The game is played either on a smartphone or a tablet, using swipe motions to control the wind and taps to affect the game environment. The game gets progressively harder the further down your character has fallen, with more obstacles and smarter enemies. While descending the character will travel through a wide variety of enchanting landscapes, each with a different color theme.
